# MtG_Card_Viewer_Android
first commit

This is an application that I created during my time at university for Android Devices. It allows you to search for Magic the Gathering
cards easily from a mobile device. Magic the Gathering is a Trading Card Game that has been around for almost 25 years now. 

If you want to try this app on your android device then download this apk file: mtgcardviewer.apk

Once you've downloaded it, transfer it across to your phone and install it.
